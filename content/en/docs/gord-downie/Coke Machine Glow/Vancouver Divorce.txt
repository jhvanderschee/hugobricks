# Lyrics
"      
What the hell is this?
You said, "It's art, just fucking mirror it"
Where did we go wrong?
If not here where do we belong?
In a shot of sun off an airplane far above her?
In the glint of the foot-burnished manhole cover?
In a light, a sign of one kind or another?
In the gleaming eye of a fighter or a lover?
     
Sitting here at the Horton's
So you know this is important
If not here then where?
If not now then when?
When a feather's an immovable force?
When the stampede's an obstacle course?
When Ancient Train has hit Old Transient Horse?
When we're a Vancouver divorce?
         
Now that we've hammered the last spike
And we've punched the railroad through
Thought there'd be more to say
Thought there'd be more to do
I love your paintings, don't take your colours away
I've grown more fearful of them every day
Swimming up their dark rivers to discover its source
A source of strange and unrequited remorse
And I found the end of the world of course
And it's not the end of the world of course
It's just a Vancouver divorce
It's just a Vancouver divorce"
