   ## Lyrics
   
   

    The myth is neither here nor there from the air
    It's just blue lake stains and green
    And purified and parcelled squares
    A crazy quilt of spearmint 

    Of mustard and honey tones
    A scuffed-up kitchen floor
    Of tiles on top of bones with a big trap door
    Towns down diagonal lines
    Disappear and drop out of sight
    Into the night
    Beyond the endless night

    And underneath the grit and glare
    In the unfettered nothingness and thin air
    As herds of clouds lazily graze
    On thermal sighs of delight
    The Starpainters are taking over now
    Their scaffolding is in its place
    Your anaesthesiologist tonight
    Is washing up and on her way
