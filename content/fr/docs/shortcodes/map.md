A map is basically [an image](/uploads/map2.png) with a marker on top of it. The marker can be found in the '/static/img/' directory. Make sure to make your map image large enough, as it does not scale. The minimum size is a 900x400 pixel image. You can see the map shortcode in action on the [Elements page](/elements/). To show the map in your content, write the following shortcode:

```
{{</* map "/uploads/map.png" "https://link.to.map.location" */>}}
```

<!--{{< map "/uploads/map.png" "https://link.to.map.location" >}}-->
