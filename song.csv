Coke Machine Glow,2001,1,Starpainters,"
The myth is neither here nor there
From the air
It's just blue lake stains and green
And purified and parcelled squares
A crazy quilt of spearmint
Of mustard and honey tones
A scuffed-up kitchen floor
Of tiles on top of bones with a big trap door
Towns down diagonal lines
Disappear and drop out of sight
Into the night
Beyond the endless night
And underneath the grit and glare
In the unfettered nothingness and thin air
As herds of clouds lazily graze
On thermal sighs of delight
The Starpainters are taking over now
Their scaffolding is in its place
Your anaesthesiologist tonight
Is washing up and on her way",,"test, test"
Coke Machine Glow,2001,2,Vancouver Divorce,"      
What the hell is this?
You said, ""It's art, just fucking mirror it""
Where did we go wrong?
If not here where do we belong?
In a shot of sun off an airplane far above her?
In the glint of the foot-burnished manhole cover?
In a light, a sign of one kind or another?
In the gleaming eye of a fighter or a lover?
     
Sitting here at the Horton's
So you know this is important
If not here then where?
If not now then when?
When a feather's an immovable force?
When the stampede's an obstacle course?
When Ancient Train has hit Old Transient Horse?
When we're a Vancouver divorce?
         
Now that we've hammered the last spike
And we've punched the railroad through
Thought there'd be more to say
Thought there'd be more to do
I love your paintings, don't take your colours away
I've grown more fearful of them every day
Swimming up their dark rivers to discover its source
A source of strange and unrequited remorse
And I found the end of the world of course
And it's not the end of the world of course
It's just a Vancouver divorce
It's just a Vancouver divorce",,"test, test"
